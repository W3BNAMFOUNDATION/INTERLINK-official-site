[INTERLINK — Deployment Models

Sovereign • Local-First • Air-Gapped • Enterprise-Grade

INTERLINK is engineered to deploy in any environment:  
on-premise, hybrid, multi-node, private cloud, air-gapped military networks,  
or fully isolated sovereign infrastructure.

⸻

🔷 Deployment Philosophy

INTERLINK follows a “deployment without constraints” principle:

✔ Zero cloud requirement  
✔ Runs fully local  
✔ No external APIs  
✔ No vendor lock-in  
✔ Peaks in regulated & sensitive environments  

Your infrastructure defines the fabric — not the other way around.

⸻

🔷 Deployment Model Overview

INTERLINK supports three core deployment classes:

1. **Single-Node On-Premise Deployment**  
2. **Multi-Node Distributed Fabric Deployment**  
3. **Air-Gapped / Restricted-Network Deployment**

Additional hybrid and private-cloud options extend these further.

🔷 Single-Node On-Premise Deployment

Ideal for banks, clinics, ministries, and enterprises starting with a controlled deployment.

Architecture:
• Backend (FastAPI)  
• Frontend console  
• Memory engine  
• Ingest engine  
• Filesystem + multimodal engine  
• Gibberlink node  
• CLI + API gateway  

Advantages:
• Turnkey installation  
• Full sovereignty  
• Zero cloud services  
• Perfect for pilots, POCs, and small teams  
• Zero external dependency  

Suitable For:
• Financial compliance units  
• Hospitals and clinics  
• Government units  
• Legal departments  
• Small R&D labs  

⸻

🔷 Multi-Node Distributed Deployment

The full INTERLINK fabric — designed for scale, resilience, and distributed cognition.

Node Types:
• Ingest Nodes  
• Memory Nodes  
• Reasoning Nodes  
• Filesystem Nodes  
• Multimodal Nodes  
• Gateway Nodes  
• Gibberlink Transport Mesh  

Capabilities:
• Load balancing across nodes  
• Redundant failover  
• Inter-department / multi-site fabric  
• Distributed intelligence & shared memory  
• Perfect for enterprise-wide or nation-scale deployment  

Suitable For:
• Banks with multiple departments  
• Government ministries  
• Telecoms & utilities  
• National AI centers  
• Large healthcare systems  

⸻

🔷 Air-Gapped Deployment (No Internet)

The sovereign-class deployment — fully isolated, hardened, and compliant.

Characteristics:
✔ Zero external connectivity  
✔ Physical-media-based installation  
✔ Strict cryptographic signature verification  
✔ Isolated update mechanism  
✔ No inbound or outbound traffic  
✔ Full operation in denied or classified environments  

Ideal For:
• Defense & intelligence  
• Ministries of interior & justice  
• Critical infrastructure  
• Nuclear, energy, telecoms  
• Military operational environments  
• Classified research labs  

This is where cloud AI cannot operate — and where INTERLINK excels.

⸻

🔷 Private Cloud Deployment (On Your Infrastructure)

INTERLINK supports full operation inside private cloud platforms:

Compatible With:
• VMware  
• Hyper-V  
• Proxmox  
• OpenStack  
• Azure Stack  
• AWS Outposts  
• Oracle Cloud Dedicated Region  

Capabilities:
• Containerized deployment (Docker / Podman)  
• Kubernetes orchestration  
• High-availability clusters  
• Hybrid on-prem + private-cloud fabrics  

⸻

🔷 Hybrid Deployment Models

Designed for multi-site, multi-role, multi-agency intelligence environments.

Model Types:
• Edge-Core Architecture  
• HQ–Branch–Remote multi-node topology  
• Cloud-assisted indexing with local reasoning  
• Regional memory + distributed ingest nodes  
• Global or national-scale distributed cognition  

Suitable For:
• Retail & telecoms  
• Government multi-agency networks  
• Healthcare systems with multiple hospitals  
• Large corporate ecosystems  

⸻

🔷 Performance Characteristics

INTERLINK architectures are optimized for:

• High throughput multimodal ingest  
• Sub-second reasoning responses  
• Memory retrieval at scale  
• Linear horizontal scaling  
• High availability with failover  
• Low-latency inter-node communication  

Performance Benchmarks (Typical):
• 10–100× faster ingestion compared to cloud-based solutions  
• Support for thousands of concurrent requests  
• Memory fabrics scaling into hundreds of millions of embeddings  
• Distributed pipelines capable of national-scale deployment  

⸻

🔷 Infrastructure Requirements (Typical)

Small Deployment:
• 8–16 vCPU  
• 16–32 GB RAM  
• 500 GB–1 TB SSD  
• 1–3 nodes  

Medium Deployment:
• 16–32 vCPU  
• 32–64 GB RAM  
• 1–5 TB high-performance SSD  
• 3–10 nodes  

Large / Enterprise Deployment:
• 32–64+ vCPU  
• 64–128+ GB RAM  
• 5–20 TB NVMe  
• 10–50+ nodes  

⸻

🔷 Advantages of INTERLINK Deployment

✔ Zero vendor lock-in  
✔ Fully sovereign AI infrastructure  
✔ High security, zero-trust architecture  
✔ Distributed cognition at enterprise scale  
✔ Air-gapped capability  
✔ Compliance-by-design  
✔ Predictable cost structure  
✔ No API usage fees  
✔ No cloud exposure  
✔ Built for mission-critical operations  

⸻

🔷 Final Statement

INTERLINK adapts to your infrastructure, not the opposite.

Whether you are deploying inside a corporate datacenter, a hospital, a ministry, a research facility, or a classified military network —  
INTERLINK operates with the same strength, security, and sovereignty.
