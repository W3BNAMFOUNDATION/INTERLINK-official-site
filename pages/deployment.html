[INTERLINK — Deployment Models & Infrastructure Strategy

Sovereign • Distributed • Air-Gapped • Enterprise-Grade

INTERLINK is engineered to deploy in any environment — from corporate datacenters to fully air-gapped defense facilities — while maintaining complete sovereignty, multimodal capability, and distributed cognition.

This page details every supported deployment model and the architecture strategies that enable INTERLINK to operate where no cloud AI system can.

🔷 Overview

INTERLINK supports six enterprise-grade deployment models:

1. **Single-Node On-Premise**
2. **Multi-Node Distributed Fabric**
3. **Air-Gapped Deployment**
4. **Hybrid Enterprise Deployment**
5. **Private Cloud Deployment**
6. **Edge + Core Federated Deployment**

Each model preserves:
• Zero external cloud dependency  
• Full data residency  
• Native multimodal ingest  
• Distributed cognitive fabric  
• Zero-Fault security  
• Enterprise-grade governance

• No internet required  
• Full operational capability  
• Local-only Web UI access  
• Optional offline installer  

Benefits:
• Maximum simplicity  
• Full sovereignty  
• Zero external dependencies

• Classified-level protection  
• Compliant with defense regulations  

Use Cases:
• Military bases  
• Intelligence agencies  
• Nuclear facilities  
• Critical infrastructure  
• National sovereign AI programs  

⸻

🔷 Hybrid Enterprise Deployment

For organizations transitioning from cloud to sovereign AI.

Architecture:
• On-premise reasoning + memory  
• Edge ingest nodes  
• Controlled cloud adjacency  
• Strict data routing policies  

Examples:
• Banks with multi-branch ingest  
• Hospitals with hybrid networks  
• Telco networks with regional segmentation  

Benefits:
• Gradual migration  
• Controlled compliance boundaries  
• Centralized sovereign reasoning  

⸻

🔷 Private Cloud Deployment

Supported on:
• VMware  
• Hyper-V  
• KVM  
• OpenStack  
• Azure Stack  
• AWS Outposts  

Capabilities:
• Virtualized nodes  
• Distributed mesh across VMs  
• High-availability clusters  
• Compliance-aligned or sovereign cloud  

Benefits:
• Elastic scaling  
• Zero vendor lock-in  
• Private cloud sovereignty  

⸻

🔷 Edge + Core Federated Deployment

Distributed intelligence across:
• Hospitals  
• Bank branches  
• Government agencies  
• Field units  
• Factories  
• Remote sites  

Architecture:
• Edge nodes perform ingest + local reasoning  
• Core cluster performs global reasoning  
• Federated memory fabric  
• Secure cross-region mesh  

Benefits:
• Low latency  
• Resilient architecture  
• Local autonomy + global intelligence
