[INTERLINK — Security & Compliance

Sovereign • Zero-Trust • Audit-Ready • Mission-Critical

INTERLINK is engineered for environments where failure is not an option:
finance, government, defense, intelligence, healthcare, and critical infrastructure.

Security is not an add-on.
It is the foundation.

🔷 Zero-Trust Cognitive Architecture

INTERLINK applies a strict “never trust, always verify” model across all nodes, modules, users, and data flows.

Core Zero-Trust Principles:
• Identity-centric access for every request  
• Continuous authentication & authorization  
• Micro-segmentation of all processes  
• Policy-driven access boundaries  
• No implicit trust between modules or nodes  
• Full audit visibility across the entire fabric  

Every interaction inside the cognitive fabric is authenticated, validated, logged, and cryptographically verified.

🔷 Security Framework Overview

INTERLINK provides a multilayer defensive architecture:

Layer 1 — Access Control  
• RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)  
• ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)  
• PBAC (Policy-Based Access Control)  
• Temporal & contextual access boundaries  
• Emergency “break-glass” access with full audit trail  

Layer 2 — Data Protection  
• AES-256 encryption at rest  
• End-to-end encrypted node communication  
• SHA-384 integrity verification  
• Automatic PII/PHI detection & redaction  
• Sovereign data residency controls  

Layer 3 — Network Security  
• Zero external dependencies  
• Air-gapped optional deployment  
• Encrypted Gibberlink™ transport  
• Segmented internal communication  
• No open cloud endpoints  

Layer 4 — Operational Security  
• Automated policy enforcement  
• Audit log immutability  
• Behavioral anomaly detection  
• Insider threat detection  
• Secure boot & signed modules

🔷 Compliance Frameworks

INTERLINK includes compliance-ready controls for:

Financial Sector  
• FINRA  
• SOX  
• PCI-DSS  
• Basel III  
• AML/KYC automation  

Government & Defense  
• NIST SP 800-53  
• FISMA  
• FedRAMP (architectural alignment)  
• DoD SRG  
• CNSS  
• NIAP  
• DISA STIG  

Healthcare  
• HIPAA  
• HITECH  
• CLIA  
• FDA SaMD guidelines  

International Standards  
• ISO 27001  
• ISO 27017 / 27018  
• GDPR  
• MDR / EMA  
• International data-sovereignty frameworks  

INTERLINK can operate in fully sovereign, regulation-constrained environments where most AI platforms cannot legally function.

🔷 Data Sovereignty & Residency

A core differentiator of INTERLINK:

✔ 100% local deployment  
✔ Zero cloud dependency  
✔ All data stays inside the organization  
✔ National-border-bound residency controls  
✔ Compliance with jurisdiction-specific mandates  

Whether in a bank, ministry, military environment, nuclear facility, or healthcare system — data never leaves the secured perimeter.

🔷 Air-Gapped & Restricted-Network Operation

INTERLINK supports fully isolated environments:

• No internet connection required  
• Physical-media deployment options  
• Verified-integrity update pipeline  
• Node-to-node communication via encrypted mesh  
• No reliance on external signatures or cloud APIs  

Suitable for:  
• Defense & intelligence agencies  
• Critical infrastructure  
• National AI centers  
• Secure research labs  
• Military networks  
• High-security financial institutions  

⸻

🔷 Audit, Governance & Oversight

INTERLINK includes enterprise-grade governance capabilities:

• Full activity audit trails  
• Immutable logs with cryptographic seals  
• Real-time compliance monitoring  
• Automated policy enforcement  
• Built-in reporting for regulators  
• Continuous control validation  
• Model governance & drift detection  

Designed for environments where every action must be explainable, auditable, and compliant.
