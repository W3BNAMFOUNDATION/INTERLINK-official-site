INTERLINK — Investor Relations & Strategic Capital

Sovereign • Distributed • Multimodal • Mission-Critical AI Infrastructure  
A new global category: Distributed Cognitive AI Fabric

INTERLINK is not a chatbot, not a SaaS product, and not a cloud service.  
It is sovereign AI infrastructure engineered for governments, financial institutions, healthcare systems, defense, and critical infrastructure.

For investors, INTERLINK represents one of the rarest and most strategically defensible opportunities of this decade:  
A foundational technology category with no direct competition, operating at the intersection of AI, sovereignty, cybersecurity, and national-scale infrastructure.

🔷 Investment Thesis: The Birth of a New Infrastructure Layer

INTERLINK creates — and dominates — a new category:

**Distributed Cognitive AI Fabric**

Why this matters:
• AI is becoming national infrastructure  
• Nations are banning external cloud dependencies  
• Enterprises need sovereign, local-first AI  
• Regulated sectors cannot rely on foreign AI providers  
• Every country and every Fortune 500 company will require sovereign AI infrastructure  

INTERLINK is positioned to become the foundational layer for sovereign intelligence worldwide.

🔷 Market Opportunity

Macroeconomic Drivers

AI Infrastructure Market (2030): **$1.3 Trillion**  
Sovereign AI Spending (2030): **$350 Billion**  
Government AI Modernization: **Exploding across G7, NATO, GCC, APAC**  
Enterprise Local AI Adoption: **Fastest-growing trend in enterprise tech**  

Strategic Forces Driving Demand
• Geopolitical pressure & national sovereignty  
• Rising cloud-risk & regulatory constraints  
• Surge of multimodal data volume  
• Enterprise migration to local-first LLMs  
• Security mandates requiring on-prem intelligence  
• The end of unregulated, cloud-dependent AI  

INTERLINK is built specifically for this new sovereign era.

🔷 Zero Competition: Category Creation

INTERLINK has no direct competitor.

Comparison Summary:
• Cloud AI → centralized, foreign, insecure  
• Local LLM setups → isolated, non-distributed  
• RAG systems → limited, non-sovereign  
• Agent frameworks → not infrastructure  
• “AI platforms” → SaaS tools, not sovereign fabrics  

INTERLINK is the **first and only** system that:
• Is fully sovereign  
• Is fully local  
• Is fully distributed  
• Supports multimodal reasoning  
• Runs across nodes, departments, agencies  
• Operates offline or air-gapped  
• Provides complete enterprise/government control  

We are creating a category — and owning it.
