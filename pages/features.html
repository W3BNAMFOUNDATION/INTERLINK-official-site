INTERLINK — Core Features & Capabilities
Sovereign • Distributed • Multimodal • Mission-Critical AI Infrastructure

INTERLINK is the world’s first Distributed Cognitive AI Fabric — engineered for enterprises, governments, healthcare systems, defense, and critical infrastructure requiring absolute sovereignty, full control, and zero cloud dependency.

This page provides the complete technical and operational overview of INTERLINK’s capabilities.

⸻

🔷 Core Platform Architecture

INTERLINK is built on a layered cognitive fabric engineered for sovereign, high-security environments.

Primary Architecture Layers:
• Interface Layer — Web panel, CLI, REST API, WebSocket Engine  
• Gateway Layer — FastAPI backend, authentication, routing  
• Cognitive Fabric — multimodal reasoning, ingest, memory, dispatch  
• Modules Layer — ingest, memory, filesystem, multimodal, Gibberlink  
• Storage Layer — vector memory, ingest cache, logs, secure filesystem  

Purpose of the Fabric:
A single distributed intelligence layer capable of reasoning, ingesting, understanding, and operating across nodes, departments, and agencies — safely, privately, and at scale.

🔷 Multimodal Intelligence Engine

INTERLINK processes and reasons over every enterprise data format:

Supported Modalities:
• Text (documents, emails, raw text)
• PDFs (structured, unstructured, scanned)
• Websites & URLs
• YouTube video/audio transcription
• Images & screenshots
• Audio recordings
• Local files
• Technical documentation
• Medical and scientific records

Multimodal Capabilities:
• Semantic ingestion  
• Multi-source analysis  
• Cross-reference reasoning  
• Contextual memory integration  
• Long-term retention across sessions  

This transforms disconnected enterprise data into one unified intelligence layer.

🔷 Distributed Memory Fabric

The Memory Engine provides sovereign, persistent, distributed vector memory.

Key Features:
• Semantic search with high-precision embeddings  
• Multi-profile memory modes (private, shared, distributed)  
• Persistent long-term memory storage  
• Cross-node synchronization  
• Context window expansion beyond LLM limits  
• Knowledge graph alignment  
• High-speed contextual retrieval  

This allows INTERLINK to reason over months or years of accumulated enterprise knowledge.

🔷 Gibberlink™ Distributed Protocol

The backbone of INTERLINK’s distributed cognition.

Protocol Capabilities:
• Encrypted node-to-node communication  
• Low-latency distributed execution  
• Local-first transport (no internet required)  
• Air-gapped compatibility  
• Multi-agency distributed intelligence  
• UDP-based sovereign communication design  
• Zero cloud dependency  

Gibberlink enables true distributed AI fabrics — not possible with cloud LLM architectures.

🔷 Zero-Fault Security Framework

Security is not an add-on — it is the foundation.

Core Security Controls:
• Role-based access (RBAC) with granular module permissions  
• Sanitized ingest with threat detection  
• PII/PHI detection & automatic protection  
• Secure filesystem virtualization  
• SHA-384 integrity checks  
• Restricted module access  
• Data lineage and audit flows  
• Zero-trust communication between nodes  

Compliance-Ready for:
• Finance (FINRA, SOX)  
• Government (NIST, FISMA, FedRAMP)  
• Healthcare (HIPAA, HITECH)  
• Defense (DoD SRG, STIG, ITAR, EAR)  

⸻

🔷 Sovereign Deployment Models

INTERLINK operates in any environment — including fully isolated ones.

Supported Deployment Types:
• On-prem single-node  
• Multi-node distributed fabric  
• Hybrid enterprise deployments  
• Fully air-gapped classified environments  
• Edge deployments for tactical units  
• High-performance clusters with GPU acceleration  

Every deployment is cloud-free, sovereign, and controlled entirely by the customer.

🔷 Ingest Engine Features

Supported Formats:
• PDFs (scanned & digital)  
• Websites & deep-links  
• YouTube videos & audio  
• Raw text, markdown, HTML  
• Local files (documents, logs, datasets)  

Pipeline Capabilities:
• Automatic sanitization  
• Content extraction  
• Reasoning payload preparation  
• Memory encoding & storage  
• Multi-source document linking  

⸻

🔷 Filesystem & Governance Fabric

Critical Controls:
• Secure VFS with policy-based restrictions  
• Sensitive file prevention  
• Controlled import/export  
• Enterprise audit trails  
• Governance policy enforcement  

This ensures INTERLINK can safely operate in regulated or classified domains.
