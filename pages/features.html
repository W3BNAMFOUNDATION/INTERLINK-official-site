INTERLINK — Platform Overview & Core Capabilities

Sovereign Distributed Cognitive AI Fabric  
Engineered for Enterprises, Governments, Defense & Critical Infrastructure

INTERLINK is a sovereign-by-design Distributed Cognitive AI Fabric that replaces the old model of cloud-dependent AI with a secure, multimodal, distributed intelligence platform organizations fully own and operate.  
It is not SaaS. Not a chatbot. Not an API dependency.  
INTERLINK is **infrastructure** — a complete cognitive backbone.

🔷 What INTERLINK Is

A new class of enterprise AI infrastructure that merges:
• Multimodal ingest  
• Distributed cognitive reasoning  
• Vector memory fabric  
• Zero-Fault security  
• Encrypted node-to-node mesh (Gibberlink)  
• Full data sovereignty with no external dependency  

INTERLINK enables private, secure, multimodal, real-time intelligence across:  
enterprises, governments, agencies, departments, hospitals, defense units, and national infrastructures.

🔷 Core Capabilities

1. Multimodal Ingest Engine  
   Ingests and processes:  
   • PDFs, documents, internal files  
   • Websites, URLs, structured data  
   • Audio, video, YouTube, meeting recordings  
   • Operational logs, reports, and intelligence feeds  
   All processed content becomes part of the distributed memory fabric.

2. Vector Memory Fabric  
   • High-performance semantic memory  
   • Long-term retention with contextual understanding  
   • Distributed memory nodes across departments or regions  
   • Instant recall for reasoning, decision support, and automation  

3. Distributed Cognitive Reasoning  
   • Unified reasoning engine  
   • Enterprise-specific modules for ingest, memory, security, and multimodal logic  
   • Executes reasoning across multiple nodes (cross-agency, cross-department)  
   • Local-first execution ensures sovereignty and compliance  

4. Zero-Fault Security Framework  
   • Policy-based access control  
   • Sanitized ingest pipeline  
   • SHA-384 verification  
   • Filesystem protection and restricted virtual environment  
   • Defense-grade security for FIN/GOV/HEALTH/DEFENSE  

5. Gibberlink™ Encrypted Transport Protocol  
   • Secure node-to-node communication  
   • Low-latency distributed intelligence mesh  
   • Functions in online, offline, hybrid, and air-gapped environments  
   • Supports national-scale AI deployments
