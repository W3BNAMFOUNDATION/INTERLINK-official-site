INTERLINK — Core Features & Enterprise Capabilities

Distributed Cognitive AI Fabric  
Sovereign • Modular • Private • Multimodal • Enterprise-Grade

INTERLINK is a sovereign, multimodal, distributed cognitive fabric engineered to replace cloud-dependent AI systems with secure, autonomous, local-first intelligence.  
It is not an application — it is foundational AI infrastructure designed for institutions where security, privacy, and regulatory compliance are non-negotiable.

⸻

🔷 Core Architecture Overview

INTERLINK is built as a multi-layer cognitive fabric composed of:

• Multimodal Ingest Engine  
• Distributed Reasoning Engine  
• Vector Memory System  
• Filesystem Security Fabric  
• Encrypted Node Mesh (Gibberlink™)  
• Web Control Panel + CLI Toolkit  

Each component is modular, sovereign, and optimized for high-security enterprise and government environments.

🔷 Multimodal Ingest Engine

The ingest engine transforms raw enterprise data into structured intelligence.

Supported inputs:
• PDFs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint  
• Websites & URLs  
• YouTube videos & audio  
• Technical documents  
• Emails, logs, and structured datasets  
• Healthcare records (HIPAA-aligned)  
• Intelligence & defense documents  
• Critical infrastructure data feeds  

Capabilities:
• Automatic cleaning & sanitization  
• Metadata extraction  
• Entity detection & semantic linking  
• Temporal ordering  
• Layered ingest profiles per department or agency  

INTERLINK creates a unified cognitive representation of all information across an organization.

🔷 Vector Memory System

High-performance, persistent, enterprise-grade semantic memory.

Core capabilities:
• Fast semantic search & retrieval  
• Long-term contextual memory  
• Multi-profile memory partitions  
• Atomic vector updates  
• High-availability memory clusters  
• Vector TTL, retention policies, and secure deletion  

Enterprise benefits:
• Institutional knowledge retention  
• Real-time intelligence recall  
• Automatic cross-department contextual linking

🔷 Cognitive Reasoning Fabric

The reasoning core executes complex multimodal, multi-step operations across distributed nodes.

Key components:
• Loader (intent construction)  
• Reasoning Router (task dispatcher)  
• Multimodal analysis layer  
• Distributed execution coordinator  
• Memory interface for contextual reasoning  

Capabilities:
• Explainable reasoning chains  
• Multi-step task execution  
• Document synthesis & transformation  
• Decision-support logic for regulated sectors  
• Distributed cognitive workflows  

This is the system’s “intelligence layer” — converting ingest + memory into actionable insights.

🔷 Filesystem Security Fabric (Zero-Fault Framework)

The security fabric enforces strict, policy-driven controls:

• Virtualized filesystem  
• Path isolation and sandboxing  
• Restricted access rules  
• No arbitrary code execution  
• SHA-384 integrity verification  
• Sanitized ingest pipeline  
• Automatic rejection of dangerous files  

This architecture ensures operational safety even in high-risk environments.

🔷 Gibberlink™ — Encrypted Distributed Transport

INTERLINK nodes communicate over **Gibberlink™**, an encrypted, low-latency mesh protocol.

Capabilities:
• Node-to-node encrypted messaging  
• Distributed memory synchronization  
• Federated reasoning requests  
• Multi-site and multi-agency coordination  
• Zero cloud dependency  
• Secure offline/air-gapped operation  

Gibberlink enables the world’s first *truly sovereign AI mesh network*.

• WebSocket live stream interaction  

Optimized for banks, government agencies, and clinical environments.

⸻

🔷 CLI Toolkit (Automation & DevOps)

Automation-grade CLI for:
• ingest  
• chat  
• raw queries  
• scripting  
• pipelines  
• batch operations  

Essential for large-scale enterprise workflows and DevOps automation.
