INTERLINK — Technical Architecture Overview
Distributed Cognitive AI Fabric • Sovereign • Modular • Private • Multimodal

INTERLINK is a new class of AI infrastructure.  
Not a model. Not a chatbot.  
A sovereign cognitive fabric engineered to operate entirely under enterprise or national control.

This page presents the complete technical architecture.

• Gibberlink Distributed Transport  

Purpose:  
Transform raw data into actionable intelligence.

—

LAYER 4 — Modules Layer

🔷 Multimodal Ingest Architecture

INTERLINK ingests and unifies every type of enterprise or national data.

Supported Modalities:
• PDFs  
• Websites  
• Raw Text  
• Audio/Video (YouTube, meeting recordings)  
• Images  
• Scanned documents  
• Logs  
• Binary files  
• Clinical/financial/government records  

Ingest Pipeline Stages:
1. Sanitization  
2. Extraction  
3. Contextual Embedding  
4. Memory Encoding  
5. Multimodal Unification  
6. Distributed Availability  

The ingest engine operates independently from models and preserves complete sovereignty over data.

🔷 Memory Engine — Contextual Vector Fabric

The Memory Engine is a sovereign, distributed vector memory with long-term retention.

Core Capabilities:
• Semantic retrieval  
• Multi-turn memory persistence  
• Multi-profile storage  
• Distributed indexing  
• Knowledge graph alignment  
• Embedding-based reasoning  
• Large-scale context reconstruction  

Memory Profiles:
• Private Memory  
• Shared Department Memory  
• Distributed Shared Fabric  
• Air-Gapped Offline Memory

🔷 Router Engine — Distributed Intelligence Logic

The Router controls all reasoning and intelligence flow across modules and nodes.

Primary Functions:
• Intent classification  
• Module dispatch  
• Load balancing  
• Cross-node routing  
• Context enrichment  
• Multimodal decision logic  

This enables a single reasoning request to activate multiple nodes or modules simultaneously.

🔷 Filesystem Fabric — Secure Virtual Filesystem

Core Controls:
• Restricted path access  
• Sensitive file protection  
• Policy-based governance  
• SHA-384 integrity hashing  
• Import validation  
• Zero-Fault constraints  

Industries requiring strict compliance (finance, healthcare, defense) rely heavily on this layer.

🔷 Gibberlink™ Distributed Protocol

The sovereign transport backbone enabling distributed cognition.

Protocol Features:
• Encrypted UDP-based communication  
• Sub-5ms node-to-node latency  
• No internet required  
• Multi-agency interoperability  
• Cross-region distributed reasoning  
• Air-gapped compatibility  
• Local-first sovereign transport  

Gibberlink enables INTERLINK to function as a **distributed brain**, not a centralized AI service.
