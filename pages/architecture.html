[INTERLINK — Technical Architecture Deep-Dive

Distributed • Modular • Multimodal • Zero-Trust • Enterprise-Grade

INTERLINK is the world’s first Distributed Cognitive AI Fabric —  
a unified architecture built to operate without cloud dependencies,  
inside regulated, sovereign, and mission-critical environments.

This page provides a full technical overview.

🔷 Core Architectural Philosophy

INTERLINK is engineered with five foundational principles:

1. **Sovereignty by Design**  
   100% local execution. Zero cloud requirements. Total data residency.

2. **Distributed Cognition**  
   Intelligence flows across nodes, not a single central model.

3. **Modular Fabric Architecture**  
   Every subsystem is independent but interoperable.

4. **Multimodal Native Capability**  
   Documents, web, audio, video, structured data — all are unified under one fabric.

5. **Zero-Fault, Zero-Trust Security**  
   Every action authenticated, validated, logged, and cryptographically verified.

🔷 Layered Architecture Overview

INTERLINK is structured into six fully modular layers:

Layer 1 — Interface Layer  
• Web control panel  
• CLI toolkit  
• WebSocket live-stream engine  
• REST API gateway  
• Integration connectors  

Layer 2 — Backend Gateway (FastAPI)  
• Request routing  
• Authentication  
• Access policy enforcement  
• Real-time API dispatch  
• WebSocket pipeline  

Layer 3 — Cognitive Fabric Core  
The heart of INTERLINK.  
Contains the mechanisms that enable reasoning, ingest, memory, and distributed execution.

Core Components:  
• Loader (intent extraction & pipeline builder)  
• Router Engine (module orchestration)  
• Memory Engine (vector retrieval & contextual reasoning)  
• Ingest Engine (multimodal pipeline)  
• Filesystem Engine (secure I/O layer)  
• Multimodal Reasoning Engine  
• Gibberlink™ Distributed Transport Layer  

Layer 4 — Modules Layer  
Specialized subsystems for enterprise-grade orchestration:

• Ingest Module  
• Memory Module  
• Filesystem Module  
• Multimodal Module  
• Distributed Transport Module (Gibberlink)  
• Security Module  
• Compliance Module  

Layer 5 — Data & Storage Layer  
• Vector memory store  
• Ingest cache  
• Immutable logs  
• Temporary processing workspace  
• Configuration profiles  
• Memory persistence engine  

Layer 6 — Distributed Layer  
• Node-to-node mesh  
• Encrypted datagrams  
• Distributed memory retrieval  
• Cross-node reasoning  
• Cluster-level orchestration

🔷 Cognitive Fabric Core (Deep Dive)

The Cognitive Fabric Core is responsible for:

• Understanding user intent  
• Selecting the correct modules  
• Routing tasks across distributed nodes  
• Integrating memory, ingest, and filesystem  
• Executing multimodal reasoning  
• Maintaining context across sessions  
• Enforcing security and compliance boundaries  

Subsystem Breakdown:

1. **Loader**  
   Extracts intent, builds task representation, validates user permissions.

2. **Router Engine**  
   Decides which module or node handles each part of the task.  
   Can distribute workloads across ingest/memory/reasoning nodes.

3. **Memory Engine**  
   Vector-based semantic retrieval with persistent storage.  
   Supports hybrid memory (short-term + long-term).

4. **Ingest Engine**  
   Processes PDFs, URLs, YouTube, websites, audio, video, text, and local files.

5. **Filesystem Engine**  
   Zero-Fault secure virtual filesystem preventing unauthorized access.

6. **Multimodal Engine**  
   Unified reasoning across text, audio, video, and documents.

7. **Gibberlink™ Transport Layer**  
   Encrypted, low-latency UDP-based mesh enabling distributed cognition.
