    <p>INTERLINK™ — Distributed Cognitive AI Fabric Sovereign • Modular • Private • Multimodal</p>
    <p>The world&#x27;s first Distributed Cognitive AI Fabric designed for enterprises requiring local-first, sovereign, private, and multimodal AI capabilities without dependence on external clouds.</p>
    <p>Overview Section</p>
    <p>What is INTERLINK™?</p>
    <p>Distributed Cognitive AI Fabric</p>
    <p>INTERLINK™ is a Distributed Cognitive AI Fabric designed for enterprises that require autonomy, privacy, and high-performance intelligence without dependence on external clouds. It represents a fundamental architectural shift in how organizations deploy, control, and benefit from artificial intelligence.</p>
    <p>Unlike traditional AI solutions that rely on centralized cloud services, INTERLINK™ operates entirely within your infrastructure, providing complete sovereignty over data, processes, and intellectual property while delivering enterprise-grade multimodal intelligence capabilities.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>· Local-first deployment with zero mandatory cloud dependency</li>
      <li>· Multimodal ingest and contextual reasoning capabilities</li>
      <li>· Distributed node communication via Gibberlink™ encrypted protocol</li>
      <li>· Enterprise-grade security with Zero-Fault architecture</li>
      <li>· Compliance-ready for regulated industries (FIN/GOV/HEALTH)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Mission &amp; Purpose Section</p>
    <p>Our Mission &amp; Purpose</p>
    <p>Redefining enterprise AI infrastructure for the sovereign era</p>
    <p>&quot;To empower organizations with sovereign AI infrastructure that protects data privacy and sovereignty, enables regulatory compliance, reduces external dependencies, and accelerates intelligent automation — all under complete enterprise control.&quot;</p>
    <p>Enterprise Sovereignty Eliminate vendor lock-in and cloud dependency while maintaining complete control over AI infrastructure, data, and intellectual property. Deploy in air-gapped environments with zero external requirements.</p>
    <p>Regulatory Compliance Built for regulated industries with inherent compliance frameworks for financial services, government, healthcare, and defense sectors. Maintain audit trails and enforce data sovereignty boundaries by design.</p>
    <p>Distributed Intelligence Enable true distributed cognition across organizational boundaries while maintaining security and control. Scale intelligence capabilities across departments, locations, and partner ecosystems.</p>
